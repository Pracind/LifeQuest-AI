# LifeQuest AI

LifeQuest AI is an app that helps you turn your big goals into small, game-like steps you can actually follow through on.
You start by entering something you want to achieve — like learning AWS, building a portfolio, or improving your fitness — and the AI automatically breaks that goal into a clear sequence of smaller checkpoints.

Each checkpoint acts like a “quest” in a game — something specific and achievable that moves you closer to your main objective. The AI not only decides what those steps should be but also assigns XP values and difficulty levels to make your progress measurable and rewarding.

When you complete a step, you can reflect briefly on what you learned, upload proof, or take a quick AI-generated quiz. These actions help you stay honest about your progress while reinforcing what you’ve achieved. Each completion gives you XP, helps you level up, and builds a visible progress path — turning self-improvement into something that feels fun, structured, and motivating rather than overwhelming.

Over time, LifeQuest AI tracks your streaks and reflections to generate a weekly summary — like a personal journal written by AI — so you can see how far you’ve come and where you can improve next.

It’s not just another productivity app or to-do list — it’s a personal progress tracker that feels like a game, designed to help you stay consistent, focused, and motivated while working toward your long-term goals.
